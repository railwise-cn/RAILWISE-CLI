### Agents

YONSOON (甬算) includes two built-in agents you can switch between with the `Tab` key.

- **build** - Default, full-access agent for development work
- **plan** - Read-only agent for analysis and code exploration
  - Denies file edits by default
  - Asks permission before running bash commands
  - Ideal for exploring unfamiliar codebases or planning changes

Also included is a **general** subagent for complex searches and multistep tasks.
This is used internally and can be invoked using `@general` in messages.

Learn more about [agents](https://yonsoon.ai/docs/agents).

### Building on YONSOON (甬算)

If you are working on a project that's related to YONSOON (甬算) and is using "yonsoon" as part of its name, for example "yonsoon-dashboard" or "yonsoon-mobile", please add a note to your README to clarify that it is not built by the YONSOON (甬算) team and is not affiliated with us in any way.

### FAQ

#### How is this different from Claude Code?

It's very similar to Claude Code in terms of capability. Here are the key differences:

- 100% open source
- Not coupled to any provider. Although we recommend the models we provide through [YONSOON (甬算) Zen](https://yonsoon.ai/zen), YONSOON (甬算) can be used with Claude, OpenAI, Google, or even local models. As models evolve, the gaps between them will close and pricing will drop, so being provider-agnostic is important.
- Out-of-the-box LSP support
- A focus on TUI. YONSOON (甬算) is built by neovim users and the creators of [terminal.shop](https://terminal.shop); we are going to push the limits of what's possible in the terminal.
- A client/server architecture. This, for example, can allow YONSOON (甬算) to run on your computer while you drive it remotely from a mobile app, meaning that the TUI frontend is just one of the possible clients.
