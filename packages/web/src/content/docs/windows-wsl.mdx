title: Windows (WSL)
description: Run RAILWISE (甬算) on Windows using WSL for the best experience.
---

import { Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components"

While RAILWISE (甬算) can run directly on Windows, we recommend using [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) for the best experience. WSL provides a Linux environment that works seamlessly with RAILWISE (甬算)'s features.

:::tip[Why WSL?]
WSL offers better file system performance, full terminal support, and compatibility with development tools that RAILWISE (甬算) relies on.

## Setup

<Steps>

1. **Install WSL**

   If you haven't already, [install WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) using the official Microsoft guide.

2. **Install RAILWISE (甬算) in WSL**

   Once WSL is set up, open your WSL terminal and install RAILWISE (甬算) using one of the [installation methods](/docs/).

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://railwise.ai/install | bash
   ```

3. **Use RAILWISE (甬算) from WSL**

   Navigate to your project directory (access Windows files via `/mnt/c/`, `/mnt/d/`, etc.) and run RAILWISE (甬算).

   ```bash
   cd /mnt/c/Users/YourName/project
   railwise
   ```

</Steps>

## Desktop App + WSL Server

If you prefer using the RAILWISE (甬算) Desktop app but want to run the server in WSL:

1. **Start the server in WSL** with `--hostname 0.0.0.0` to allow external connections:

   ```bash
   railwise serve --hostname 0.0.0.0 --port 4096
   ```

2. **Connect the Desktop app** to `http://localhost:4096`

:::note
If `localhost` does not work in your setup, connect using the WSL IP address instead (from WSL: `hostname -I`) and use `http://<wsl-ip>:4096`.
:::

:::caution
When using `--hostname 0.0.0.0`, set `RAILWISE_SERVER_PASSWORD` to secure the server.
:::

```bash
RAILWISE_SERVER_PASSWORD=your-password railwise serve --hostname 0.0.0.0
```

---

## Web Client + WSL

For the best web experience on Windows:

1. **Run `railwise web` in the WSL terminal** rather than PowerShell:

   ```bash
   railwise web --hostname 0.0.0.0
   ```

2. **Access from your Windows browser** at `http://localhost:<port>` (RAILWISE (甬算) prints the URL)

Running `railwise web` from WSL ensures proper file system access and terminal integration while still being accessible from your Windows browser.

---

## Accessing Windows Files

WSL can access all your Windows files through the `/mnt/` directory:

- `C:` drive → `/mnt/c/`
- `D:` drive → `/mnt/d/`
- And so on...

Example:

```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/YourName/Documents/project
railwise
```

:::tip
For the smoothest experience, consider cloning/copying your repo into the WSL filesystem (for example under `~/code/`) and running RAILWISE (甬算) there.

## Tips

- Keep RAILWISE (甬算) running in WSL for projects stored on Windows drives - file access is seamless
- Use VS Code's [WSL extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl) alongside RAILWISE (甬算) for an integrated development workflow
- Your RAILWISE (甬算) config and sessions are stored within the WSL environment at `~/.local/share/railwise/`
