title: ACP Support
description: Use RAILWISE (甬算) in any ACP-compatible editor.
---

RAILWISE (甬算) supports the [Agent Client Protocol](https://agentclientprotocol.com) or (ACP), allowing you to use it directly in compatible editors and IDEs.

:::tip
For a list of editors and tools that support ACP, check out the [ACP progress report](https://zed.dev/blog/acp-progress-report#available-now).
:::

ACP is an open protocol that standardizes communication between code editors and AI coding agents.

---

## Configure

To use RAILWISE (甬算) via ACP, configure your editor to run the `railwise acp` command.

The command starts RAILWISE (甬算) as an ACP-compatible subprocess that communicates with your editor over JSON-RPC via stdio.

Below are examples for popular editors that support ACP.

---

### Zed

Add to your [Zed](https://zed.dev) configuration (`~/.config/zed/settings.json`):

```json title="~/.config/zed/settings.json"
{
  "agent_servers": {
    "RAILWISE (甬算)": {
      "command": "railwise",
      "args": ["acp"]
    }
  }
}
```

To open it, use the `agent: new thread` action in the **Command Palette**.

You can also bind a keyboard shortcut by editing your `keymap.json`:

```json title="keymap.json"
[
  {
    "bindings": {
      "cmd-alt-o": [
        "agent::NewExternalAgentThread",
        {
          "agent": {
            "custom": {
              "name": "RAILWISE (甬算)",
              "command": {
                "command": "railwise",
                "args": ["acp"]
              }
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
]
```

---

### JetBrains IDEs

Add to your [JetBrains IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/) acp.json according to the [documentation](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/ai-assistant/acp.html):

```json title="acp.json"
{
  "agent_servers": {
    "RAILWISE (甬算)": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/bin/railwise",
      "args": ["acp"]
    }
  }
}
```

To open it, use the new 'RAILWISE (甬算)' agent in the AI Chat agent selector.

---

### Avante.nvim

Add to your [Avante.nvim](https://github.com/yetone/avante.nvim) configuration:

```lua
{
  acp_providers = {
    ["railwise"] = {
      command = "railwise",
      args = { "acp" }
    }
  }
}
```

If you need to pass environment variables:

```lua {6-8}
{
  acp_providers = {
    ["railwise"] = {
      command = "railwise",
      args = { "acp" },
      env = {
        RAILWISE_API_KEY = os.getenv("RAILWISE_API_KEY")
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

### CodeCompanion.nvim

To use RAILWISE (甬算) as an ACP agent in [CodeCompanion.nvim](https://github.com/olimorris/codecompanion.nvim), add the following to your Neovim config:

```lua
require("codecompanion").setup({
  interactions = {
    chat = {
      adapter = {
        name = "railwise",
        model = "claude-sonnet-4",
      },
    },
  },
})
```

This config sets up CodeCompanion to use RAILWISE (甬算) as the ACP agent for chat.

If you need to pass environment variables (like `RAILWISE_API_KEY`), refer to [Configuring Adapters: Environment Variables](https://codecompanion.olimorris.dev/getting-started#setting-an-api-key) in the CodeCompanion.nvim documentation for full details.

## Support

RAILWISE (甬算) works the same via ACP as it does in the terminal. All features are supported:

:::note
Some built-in slash commands like `/undo` and `/redo` are currently unsupported.
:::

- Built-in tools (file operations, terminal commands, etc.)
- Custom tools and slash commands
- MCP servers configured in your RAILWISE (甬算) config
- Project-specific rules from `AGENTS.md`
- Custom formatters and linters
- Agents and permissions system
